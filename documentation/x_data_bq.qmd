The entire database is quite large, and we only want to work with selected subjects. This would require us to use a pre-specified ID list.

To do this, need to upload the ID list in `csv`. But you need to first **create dataset** in the project before any uploads: our ID list will be a **table** inside a dataset.

Now upload the `subject_id.csv` in the `mimic4` dataset.

Check if it has worked by creating a query on your newly updated table.

Now it should be possible to query the data from `physionet-data.*` datasets. Remember to save the query!!!
